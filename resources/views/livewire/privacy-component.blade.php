                                        an anonymized form to provide our various services or for analysis purposes. General information is logged here, e.g. when which content from our service offering is retrieved or what pages are visited most
                                        frequently.</p>
                                    <p class="font_8">We use so-called “cookies” (small text files with configuration information). Cookies are small text files that are sent from our web server to your browser during your visit and are held by the browser on your

                                    <p class="font_8">We also use “persistent cookies” and “third-party provider cookies”. Persistent cookies remain saved on your computer even after an Internet session has ended or the browser has been closed. These cookies usually
                                        have an expiry date after which they lose their validity.</p>
                                    <p class="font_8">In particular, the cookies are used to determine the frequency of usage and the number of visitors to our websites and to be able to continue to identify your computer during a visit of our website when changing
                                        from one of our webpages to another of our webpages and to establish the end of your visit. We thus learn what part of our website and what other websites our visitors have visited. However, these usage
                                        data do not permit any conclusions with regard to the user. All of these usage data collected in anonymized form are not merged with your personal data pursuant to Section 3 of this data protection declaration
                                        and are deleted immediately on completion of the statistical analysis. The cookies are deleted after the end of the session, as soon as you terminate your browser session.</p>
                                    <p class="font_8">Persistent cookies allow us to adapt the content of our website to the behavior and interests of the respective user. The use of persistent cookies allows us to re-address users with personalized website content
                                        who have already visited the site and have shown an interest in its content. This retargeting process is anonymous, so personal data is not stored and user profiles are not combined with personal data. Persistent
                                        cookies are regularly deleted after 14 months. Where a user has submitted their e-mail address – for a download, for example – cookies are stored for 24 months.</p>

                                    <p class="font_8">When visiting a subpage of our websites that contains such a plug-in, your browser provides a link to the servers of the respective service, which means in turn that the content of the plug-in is communicated
                                        to your browser and integrated by the latter in the page shown. The information about the visit to our website is thus forwarded to the respective service. If during the visit to our website, you are also
                                        registered with the respective service at the same time via your personal user account (e.g. via another browser session), this service can assign the visit to our website to your account.</p>
                                    <p class="font_8">With the aid of the plug-ins, users can share or post links to corresponding webpages in social networks such as Facebook, Instagram or LinkedIn, or recommend the content there. By your active interaction with
                                        these plug-ins, e.g. by clicking on the respective button or leaving a comment, this corresponding information is communicated directly to the respective service and saved there.</p>
                                    <p class="font_8">If you wish to prevent such transmission of data, you must log out from your user account of the respective service before visiting our webpages. The scope and purpose of the data collection by the respective
                                        service and the further processing and usage of your data there can be found in the data protection information directly on the webpage of the service.</p>

                                        plug-ins by the LinkedIn logo or the “Recommend” button on our website. When you visit our webpages, a direct connection is established between your browser and the LinkedIn server via the plug-in. LinkedIn
                                        thus receives the information that you have visited our website with your IP address. When you click on the LinkedIn “Recommend” button while you are logged into your LinkedIn account, you can link the content
                                        of our webpages on your LinkedIn profile. LinkedIn can thus assign the visit of our webpages to your user account. We would like to point out that as a provider of the webpages we do not gain any knowledge

                                        usage of this website is usually transmitted to a server of Google in the USA and saved there. Google may also transmit this information to third parties if this is stipulated by the law or if third parties

                                        has been extended by the code “gat._anonymizeIp();” on this website in order to guarantee an anonymized recording of IP addresses (so-called IP masking).</p>

                                        from their Google Account being used to personalize ads. To support this feature, Google Analytics captures Google-authenticated IDs from these users. This personal data is temporarily linked to the Google
